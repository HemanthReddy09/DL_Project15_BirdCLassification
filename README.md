# DL_Project15_BirdCLassification

## Introduction:

Classifying birds from their images is a very challenging task as birds canâ€™t be photographed easily as they are animals that are very sensitive to their surroundings. Their data is scarce, especially species-wise. Using deep learning algorithms, primarily CNN-based, to classify or identify these species are being implemented. In this project, we used ResNet-50 with attention module layers to classify the images of birds. This would be compared to the put bassline model, just the ResNet-50. These two models have been implemented to perform comparative testing.

### How to run our project: 

### The Dataset:

1. Since we have considered a sample of 10 species of birds we have separated them to a different folder. Use this data to test the code

USE the data present in this link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lLaMBCR541fPho_528XZPQqIluP4uHUc 

In the above link 2 folder Train and Test are present, In each of these folders as 10 birds training and testing data are present respectively

To increase the number of species of birds link for the full database is provided below. 

USE the Data present in this link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v1LMgHAt1DER01DCHwL5EYI5ogE_TX1E 

In the above link is for the full dataset, In the folder images as 200 folders of bird species. Inside each of these folders is Test data and Train data for every species as shown below.

To use these files,
2. First create a Train and Test folder separately at a different file location
3. Inside the newly created train and test folders create separate folders for each species in train
4. Replicate these folders into test (make sure the newly created species folders are empty)
5. From the given dataset link now you copy the train and test folders of the species into their respective species folders present in the newly created Train and Test. Illustration given below:

To run the project download the given IPYNB file and use Colab preferably to run the project and provide the correct directory address to load the given dataset.
